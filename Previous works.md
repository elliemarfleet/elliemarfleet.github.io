# Undergraduate dissertation

My undergraduate dissertation involved analysing a new form of *big*-data, as my collaboration with private sector company [huq](https://huq.io/) provided me with an extract of their mobile-phone data (MPD) from 2019. The analysis of this dataset through **Excel, R, QGIS** and **MapInfo** provided an insight into the potential uses of MPD to infer origin-destination travel to work behaviours, as the representativeness of this dataset was identified through comparison with 2011 commuting statistics. The findings of this project can be used to inform policy making, as a real-time refresh on now outdated census statistics indicates the busiest commuting routes and potential areas for expansion, of which autonomous vehicles could be trialled as their potential usage has been verified by local demand (hence the connections to my [PhD project](Phd project.md)).

# Edge Analytics work placement 

My workplace project with [Edge Analytics](https://edgeanalytics.co.uk/) during the final year of my undergraduate degree involved evaluating the robustness of mid-year local authority population estimates, identifying where the level of error is likely to be most significant and the reasons driving these errors. The findings of this project are integral for the support of public service planning (education, housing, social care, healthcare), as the rise of COVID-19 has proved the importance of accurate population estimates to ensure health services are equipped to cater for the populations they serve.


# Forecasting residential property demand

During my summer placement at [Property Market Analysis](https://www.pma.co.uk/home/) in Covent Garden, I leant the research process the company adopt to document, analyse and forecast UK residential developments whilst working within their UK Retail Team. Their amalgamation of every planning application submitted since 1st January 2013 providing 50 or more residential units formed the basis of their database, which is updated every year to include the applications submitted within the previous year. During my task of updating their database, I learnt skills which enhanced my ability to perform accurate desk based research, and more general knowledge surrounding the planning process in England, the likely conditions resulting in a rejection of an application and developer’s roles in providing supplementary documentation regarding the tenure, format, location, size and cost of pipeline developments.

At the end of my placement, I presented my findings to company partners to indicate the most significant pipeline developments which would alter client’s decisions to invest, as some potential hotspots were already experiencing re-development. Additionally, I addressed issues with the research process that they had been using since 2013, as certain planning applications were being missed due to specific keywords implemented within their framework of searching on cities online planning portals. I presented examples of planning applications that their framework failed to cater for – which were often bringing over 500 new residential units to areas, which without recognition could dramatically alter investment prospects. By providing new and updated keywords to support their research framework which will be used by this year’s research team, I was able to innovatively update a pre-existing framework in which the limitations had been overlooked by long term members of the company.
