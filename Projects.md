## ABM project

This [link](https://github.com/elliemarfleet/PFSS-Python) provides access to my GitHub repository of which you can access the code needed to run the ABM in the programming language of Python.

The model algorithm follows:
- Reads data into an environment
- Scrapes web data to initialise agents
- Initialises agents which move, eat, and share (with each other)
- Randomly moves the agents on an animated GUI plot
- If agents eat more than 100 stores of data they are 'sick' and the stores are deposited in the environment
- Prints their total store (amount eaten) to a file

**It is recommended you consult the [README](https://github.com/elliemarfleet/PFSS-Python/blob/main/README.md) file before attempting to run the model.**

Enjoy!
