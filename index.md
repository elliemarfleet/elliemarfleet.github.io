# About me
My name is Ellie Marfleet and I am originally from Leicester but I have lived in Leeds for over three years now. This year I graduated with a first class BA Geography degree from University of Leeds, and have remained at this University to undertake further postgraduate study. I am now in my first year of an integrated Msc/PhD; a scheme is hosted through the [CDT](https://datacdt.org/). I am a beginner programmer, with basic experience in R which I implemented during the final year of my undergraduate degree.
